# Restaurant-Reviews-ML
This project performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. It starts by loading a dataset of restaurant reviews and preprocessing the text. The text is then converted into numerical feature vectors by CountVectorizer. After splitting the data into training and test sets, a Naive Bayes classifier classifies the reviews as positive or negative.
